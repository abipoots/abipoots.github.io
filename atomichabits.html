<h2 class="font-arial text-center text-xl"> LAW 1: MAKE IT OBVIOUS</h2> 
<br/>
<h3 class="font-arial text-lg"> THE HABITS SCORECARD </h3>
<br/>
<br/> 
Create a list of all your daily habits.  Label them good(+), bad (-) or neutral (=). </br>
Examples: <ul> <li> wake up = check my phone - </li>
               <li> turn off alarm = brush my teeth + </li>
          </ul>
<br/> 
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg"> POINTING AND CALLING </h3>
<br/>
Say out loud the action you are thinking of taking, and what the outcome will be.
<br/>
<br/> 
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS</h3>
<br/> 
<p>I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]        *specificity is key*</p>
<br/>
<br/> 
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">HABIT STACKING</h3><br/> 
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT] 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<p>e.g. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.</br>
e.g. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.</br>
e.g. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.</p>
<br/>
<br/> 
<h4><em> Advanced Habit Stacking:</em></h4></br>
<ul>
  <li><em>When I want to buy something over £100, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing.</em></li>
  <li><em>When I buy a new item, I will give something away.</em></li>
  <li>em>When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering.</em></li>
</ul>
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">FINDING THE RIGHT TRIGGERS FOR YOUR HABIT STACKS</h3></br>
Make a list of daily habits and a list of things that happen to you each day.  (e.g. sun rises, sun sets, song ends, text message received)</br> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Search for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h3><p></p><p class="text-red-600 text-sm">BE THE ARCHITECT</p> 
</br>
It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.</br>
Habits are associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context (e.g. drinking more in social situations because hearing music, seeing beers on tap, watching friends order drinks)</br>
Make cues a big part of your environment: 
<ul><li> Want to drink more water? Place water bottles around the house.</li>
<li>Want to practise guitar more often? Place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.</li>
</ul> 
</br>
</br>
<h2><h2 class="font-arial text-xl center">LAW 2: MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE </h2>
</br> 
</br>
<centre>IT IS THE ANTICIPATION OF A REWARD - NOT THE FULFILLMENT OF IT- THAT GETS US TO TAKE ACTION.</br>
DESIRE IS THE ENGINE THAT DRIVES BEHAVIOUR.</br>
EVERY ACTION IS TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE ANTICIPATION THAT PRECEDES IT.</centre> 
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">THE DOPAMINE SPIKE</h3>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">TEMPTATION BUNDLING</h3><p>(Pairing actions you WANT to do with actions you NEED to do)</p></br>
<ol>
    <li> After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</li>
    <li>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</li>
</ol>
</br>
<em> e.g. If you want to watch sports, but you need to make more sales calls.
<ol>
  <li>After I get back from lunch, I will call 3 potential clients. [need]</li>
  <li>After i call 3 potential clients, I will check ESPN.  [want]<li>
</ol></em>
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">JOIN A CULTURE WHERE YOUR DESIRED BEHAVIOUR IS THE NORMAL BEHAVIOUR</h3>
<text-red-600>THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS: WHATEVER HABITS ARE NORMAL IN YOUR CULTURE ARE AMONG THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BEHAVIOURS YOU'LL FIND.</text-red-600>
</br>
We tend to imitate the habits of the close, the many and the powerful.
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">MOTIVATION RITUALS</h3> <p class="text-sm">test</p>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Change <em>"I have to"</em> to <em>"I get to"</em></li>
  <li>Reframing Perspective. (e.g. 'liberated by' rather than 'confined by' my wheelchair)</li>
  <p><span class="tab"><span>HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS. "I need to go run" to "Time to build endurance and get fast."</p>
  <p>e.g. before you do something that makes you truly happy, take 3 deep breaths and smile.  THEN you can use "take 3 deep breaths and smile" to feel happy.</p>
    </br>
  </br>
<h2><h2 class="font-arial text-center text-xl">LAW 3: MAKE IT EASY</h2>
   <br/>
   <br/>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">PRIME YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h3>
  </br>
  <p>e.g. Want to exercise?  Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag etc.</p></br>
<p>Also "resetting the room" strategy e.g. throw rubbish out when you leave your car."</p>
<p><span class="tab"><span> e.g. arrange pillows, fold blankets etc. when finished in the living room.</p>
  </br>
</br>
  <h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">MASTER THE DECISIVE MOMENT</h3>
    </br>
<p>These choices stack up and affect your life. </br>
e.g. when you get home, do you change into your gym clothes?  Or sit on the sofa?</p>
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">THE 2-MINUTE RULE</h3>
  </br>
</br>
Don't do too much too soon.  "When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes to do."
<p><span class="tab"><span>e.g Read before bed each night → Read one page.</br>
  <span>e.g. Do 30 minutes of yoga → Take out my yoga mat.</p>

</br>
</br>
<center>WHAT IS REWARDED IS REPEATED.  WHAT IS PUNISHED IS AVOIDED.</center> 
  </br>
<center>POSITIVE EMOTIONS CULTIVATE HABITS; NEGATIVE EMOTIONS DESTROY THEM.</center>
</br> 
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">REWARD YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY</h3>
  e.g. skipping on buying something -> put it in a savings account for something specific.</br>
Brainstorm.  Massage, bubble bath, spa day, early night etc. 
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">USE VISUAL TRACKERS</h3>
  e.g. The Paperclip Strategy</br>
Keep a track of your habit streak and "don't break the chain". 
</br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">NEVER MISS TWICE</h3> 
  When you forget to do a habit, get back on track immediately. 
  </br>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">FINDING A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOUR</h3>
  </br>
Ask: 
<ul>
  <li> What feels like fun to me, but work to others? </li>
  <li> What makes me lose track of time? </li>
  <li> Where do I get greater returns than the average person? </li>
  <li> What comes naturally to me? </li> 
</ul>
</br>
<h3><h3 class="font-arial text-lg">If you can't find a game, create one.</h3>
  [e.g. Scott Adams could draw better than average, and was funnier than average.  Few people can draw well and write jokes.  Added his business background and "Dilbert" was created.] </br>
