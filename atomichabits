<h2 class="font-arial text-center text-lg"> LAW 1: MAKE IT OBVIOUS
</h2> 
<br/>
<h3 class="font-arial text-lg text-purple-600"> THE HABITS SCORECARD </h3>
<br/>
<br/> 
Create a list of all your daily habits.  Label them good(+), bad (-) or neutral (=). </br>
Examples: <ul> <li> wake up = check my phone - </li>
               <li> turn off alarm = brush my teeth + </li>
          </ul>
<br/> 
<h3> POINTING AND CALLING </h3>
<br/>
Say out loud the action you are thinking of taking, and what the outcome will be.
<br/>
<br/> 
<h3>IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS</h3>
<br/> 
<p>I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]        *specificity is key*</p>
<br/>
<br/> 
<h3> HABIT STACKING</h3><br/> 
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT] 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<p>e.g. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.</br>
e.g. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.</br>
e.g. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.</p>
<br/>
<br/> 
<h4 class="em"> Advanced Habit Stacking:</h4></br>
<ul>
  <li><em>When I want to buy something over Â£100, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing.</em></li>
  <li><em>When I buy a new item, I will give something away.</em></li>
  <li>em>When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering.</em></li>
</ul>
</br>
</br>
<h3>FINDING THE RIGHT TRIGGERS FOR YOUR HABIT STACKS</h3></br>
Make a list of daily habits and a list of things that happen to you each day.  (e.g. sun rises, sun sets, song ends, text message received)</br> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Search for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.</br>
</br>
<h3>DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h3><p></p><p class="text-red-600 text-sm">BE THE ARCHITECT</p> 
</br>
It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.</br>
Habits are associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context (e.g. drinking more in social situations because hearing music, seeing beers on tap, watching friends order drinks)</br>
Make cues a big part of your environment: 
<ul><li> Want to drink more water? Place water bottles around the house.</li>
<li>Want to practise guitar more often? Place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.</li>
</ul> 
</br>
</br>
<h2> LAW 2: MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE </h2>
</br> 
</br>
<centre>IT IS THE ANTICIPATION OF A REWARD - NOT THE FULFILLMENT OF IT- THAT GETS US TO TAKE ACTION.</br>
DESIRE IS THE ENGINE THAT DRIVES BEHAVIOUR.</br>
EVERY ACTION IS TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE ANTICIPATION THAT PRECEDES IT.</centre> 
</br>
</br>
<h3>THE DOPAMINE SPIKE</h3>
<h3>TEMPTATION BUNDLING</h3><p>(Pairing actions you WANT to do with actions you NEED to do)</p></br>
<ol>
    <li> After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</li>
    <li>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</li>
</ol>
</br>
<em> e.g. If you want to watch sports, but you need to make more sales calls.
</br>
<ol>
  <li>After I get back from lunch, I will call 3 potential clients. [need]</li>
  <li>After i call 3 potential clients, I will check ESPN.  [want]<li>
</ol>
</br>
