    <h2>PAGE TITLE HERE</h2>
    <p>
      This is where you write.
    </p>
    <p>
      In between each paragraph, just use those close and open p tags.
      I like writing one sentence per line here.
      But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
      It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
      Just write inside an HTML file directly!
      So much simpler.

    <p>
      You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
      Or insert an image like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://sivers.org/images/kids-raft.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it!
