       <br/> 
		<p> As much as I like to curl up in a corner and read books all day, I am really and truly a people person.  I really love people and am obsessed with understanding human behaviour.  Why that is I do not know, but I have always been that way.  

While I believe you can choose many aspects of your personality and character, I don’t think it’s possible to change what truly ‘ignites your fire’ - i.e. what you are truly passionate about and how you feel truly fulfilled.  So I’m just going to surrender to it. </p> 
	       </br> 
	       <p> I feel fulfilled when I have positively impacted someone’s life.  </p>
	  </br> 
	       <p> Hmm great Abbie, but what does that even mean? </p>
	    </br> 
	<p> Well, the thing is, whether you like to think about it or not, we all impact each other’s lives.  We are all individually responsible for the choices we make, the actions we take, and the kind of interactions we choose to have (or not have) with each other on a daily basis.  

And I guess that’s the main point of my “message”, which I’ll split into three themes: </p> 
	</br>
<p><b> 1. Understanding Ourselves </b> </br>
	  If we put the effort into observing our thoughts, urges, and behaviours, and investigating the underlying reasons for them, then we should be able to exercise more control over ourselves - because we have raised our level of self-awareness.  <i>Often the problem we have with other people, is actually a problem that we have with ourselves.</i> </p> 
</br>
<p><b> 2. Understanding Others </b> </br>
In a word, empathy.  Accept that others brains are wired differently to your own.  There are theories and studies that can help a lot by classifying and explaining common personality types and traits - but we should be mindful not to take them as gospel and remember that every person is completely unique. </p> 
</br>
<p><b> 3. Learning how to Communicate </b></br>
<p> Have you ever felt misunderstood?  If you haven’t, then please contact me immediately so I can learn from you!  There are few things more frustrating than being misunderstood during a critical conversation.  But communication is not only about clarity, but also about picking up on non-verbal cues so that you know how people are feeling and not just what they are saying.  Some of us tend to be more naturally intuitive than others, but communication skills can definitely be learned.</p>  
</br> 
<p> Ok great, but how do I do these things? </p> 
</br> 
<p> Over the years I’ve invested a lot of time into my own personal development which involves reading (alot) of books, making notes, writing, and “life experimenting’- details of which I often share with friends, family and … anyone who’ll listen really.  I’m a big believer in knowledge-sharing, especially if I think it’s knowledge that will positively impact your life.  In fact, I think it would be rude not to share!  So welcome again to my website, and I hope you find some information here of value.</p>
